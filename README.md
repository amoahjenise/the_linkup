## App Description

This React web application aims to provide users with a platform to create, browse, and interact with linkup events. A linkup event represents an organized activity with attributes such as activity type, date/time, location, and gender preference. Users can create, update, and delete their own linkup events. The app fosters communication between users through a messaging system and facilitates the scheduling and coordination of linkup events.

### Key Features

- **Linkup Creation and Management:**
  - Users can create linkup events with details including activity type, date/time, location, and gender preference.
  - Linkup creators can update and delete their own linkup events.
  
- **Home Page Feed:**
  - The home page displays a feed of linkup events based on the user's gender preference.
  - Users can browse and view details of linkup events.
  
- **Messaging System:**
  - Users can exchange messages related to specific linkup events.
  - Conversations are organized and linked to the relevant linkup events.
  
- **Notification System:**
  - Creators of linkup events receive notifications for new messages and participation requests.
  
- **Requesting Participation:**
  - Users interested in a linkup event can send participation requests along with messages to the event creator.
  
- **Accepting and Initializing Linkups:**
  - Linkup creators can accept participation requests and initialize linkups.
  - The app sets reminders for both parties regarding the scheduled linkup event.
  
### Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure for maintainability:

- `client/`: Contains the frontend code of the React web application.
- `server/`: Houses the backend services for various functionalities such as authentication, user management, linkup management, messaging, and notifications.
- `client/src/`: Contains the frontend components, pages, and context related to the app's user interface.
- `server/xxx-service/`: Represents individual backend services responsible for specific functionalities.

### Collaboration and Support

This app is designed to facilitate social interactions through organized linkup events. It is intended to serve as a foundation for enhancing user engagement and community building. The well-organized project structure and modular design aim to make ongoing development, maintenance, and feature expansion efficient and scalable.

For any inquiries, contributions, or support requests, please refer to the documentation and codebase available in this repository. We welcome collaboration from the developer community to help further improve and expand the capabilities of this app.

# Linkup App Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Linkup app, a platform that enables users to create, manage, and participate in linkup events. Linkups are user-generated events for various activities, and this app facilitates communication and organization among participants.

## Linkup Creation and Management

The Linkup app provides users with the ability to create, edit, and delete linkup events. The process involves the following steps:

- Users input activity, date/time, location, and gender preference in the CreateLinkupForm component (CreateLinkupForm.js).
- Data is sent to the server via an API call (linkupAPI.js) for storage.
- Created linkups are displayed on the Home Page with an 'active' status.
- Linkups can be edited through the EditCreateLinkupForm component (EditCreateLinkupForm.js).
- Deleted linkups are removed from the Home Page by using the delete API call (linkupAPI.js).

## Linkup Display and Filtering

The Home Page (HomePage.js) displays linkups based on the user's gender preference. Key features include:

- Fetching and displaying active linkups using an API call (linkupAPI.js).
- Applying gender-based filtering to show relevant linkups.
- Ensuring gender-neutral linkups are displayed to all users.

## Linkup Details and Messaging

Users can view and interact with linkup details via the SendRequestPage (SendRequestPage.js). This component allows:

- Viewing linkup information and sending a message to the linkup creator.
- API calls (messagingAPI.js) for sending and receiving messages.
- Linking conversations to specific linkups.

## Notification System

A notification system enhances user experience:

- Notifications are sent using the notificationAPI.js.
- Notifications are stored in Redux (notificationReducer.js) and displayed on the UI.
- Users can mark notifications as read.

## Accepting and Initializing Linkups

After messaging, users can accept or decline linkup requests:

- The MessagesPage component (MessagesPage.js) displays conversations.
- ChatComponent (Chat.js) allows users to chat.
- Users can accept or decline linkup requests.
- Accepted linkups trigger reminders for participants.

## State Management

Redux (redux/) is used for managing app state:

- Actions (actions/) and reducers (reducers/) manage registration data, user data, linkup info, messages, and notifications.
- Ensures a consistent and predictable state throughout the app.

## Component Architecture

The app follows a modular component structure (components/):

- Components are divided into smaller units for maintainability.

## Styling and UI

A cohesive UI enhances user experience:

- makeStyles from "@material-ui/core/styles" ensures consistent styling.
- User-friendly interfaces follow intuitive design principles.

## Server and API Endpoints

The backend (server/) services handle authentication, user management, linkup management, messaging, and notifications:

- API endpoints manage authentication, user actions, linkup actions, messaging, and notifications.
- Docker and Redis are utilized for enhanced app performance and scalability.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the Linkup app's features and functionalities. For detailed implementation and code examples, please refer to the app's source code.
